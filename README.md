This project is all about controlling your Home Appliances using SIRC Remote Control. I have made this system by combining my previous projects which includes:- 

A Remote Controled Fan
Water Level Controller with automatic as well as manalcontrol
Remote Controller lights

Apart from these you can add many more by yourself.
